# Deep Learning Playground ðŸ§ âœ¨

This repo is my sandbox for experimenting with neural networks and deep learning architectures.

## ðŸ§© Whatâ€™s inside
- Basic projects with PyTorch or TensorFlow.
- First CNN models (e.g., MNIST classifier).
- Experiments with training, overfitting, regularization.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
To get hands-on experience with deep learning frameworks and neural nets.

## ðŸš€ Next steps
- Try transfer learning.
- Build simple RNN/LSTM.
- Train and fine-tune real-world models.
